# Text-Frequency-Analyzer
Created a Python project that analyzes word frequency in a text file and generates a bar plot visualization of the results. Leveraged Python's file handling, string manipulation, and data visualization libraries to transform raw text into insightful visual representations. The command-line interface enables easy interaction with the project.
