# Word Frequency Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing the frequency of words in a given text file and creating a bar plot to visualize the top twenty most frequently occurring words. The process involves a series of steps to process the text, count word frequencies, and present the results through data visualization.

Project Overview

Objective: Analyze word frequency in a text file and create a bar plot for visualization.
Outcome: A bar plot showcasing the top twenty most frequently occurring words in the text.
Learning: This project enhances skills in text preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization.

Project Steps

Text Preprocessing: The text is read from the supplied text file and converted to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive analysis. Punctuation marks are removed to accurately count words.

Word Counting: Words are split from the preprocessed text, and their frequencies are counted using the collections.Counter class.

Top Words Selection: The twenty words with the highest frequencies are selected using the most_common method.

Data Visualization: Using the matplotlib library, a bar plot is created to visually represent the top twenty words and their frequencies. The x-axis displays words, and the y-axis shows their frequencies.

Annotations: The actual frequency values are displayed on top of each bar for clearer insights.


Learning Outcomes

Through this project, you've gained experience in text preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. You've learned to work with real-world text data and extract valuable insights. This project also serves as a foundation for further exploration of text mining, natural language processing, and more.
